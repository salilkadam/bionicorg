# Create Story Workflow

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive story file that gives the dev agent everything needed for flawless implementation.

**Your Role:** Story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters.

## MANDATORY PROCESS RULES

- **R3 Traceability:** the story header records its parent epic → capability → GOAL.
- **R1 No mock integration tests:** any integration/E2E test task names the REAL infrastructure it hits + an infra-precheck; never an in-memory fake / in-process stub / monkeypatched service.
- **R2 Infra gap:** if the story needs unwired infrastructure, mark it blocked on the Infrastructure Epic — do not let a mock satisfy it.
- **R4/R5 QA acceptance:** the story's Definition of Done includes the adversarial QA real-app run on real infrastructure (mock audit + break-the-journey). The story is not done until QA passes.

- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation
- COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX, vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work
- EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important function in the entire development process!
- UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly
- SAVE QUESTIONS: If you think of questions or clarifications during analysis, save them for the end after the complete story is written
- ZERO USER INTERVENTION: Process should be fully automated except for initial epic/story selection or missing documents

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story`
- `template` = `{installed_path}/template.md`
- `validation` = `{installed_path}/checklist.md`
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `epics_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/epics.md`
- `prd_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/prd.md`
- `architecture_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`
- `ux_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`
- `story_title` = "" (will be elicited if not derivable)
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/{{story_key}}.md`

### Input Files

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
