# Create Tasks Workflow

**Goal:** Atomize a story's Tasks/Subtasks into self-contained task files that sub-agents can implement in a single short session without loading any external documents.

**Your Role:** Task decomposition engine that prevents context overload in sub-agents.

## MANDATORY PROCESS RULES

- **R3 Traceability:** each task file names its parent story (→ epic → capability → GOAL).
- **R1 No mock integration tests:** every integration/E2E test task states the REAL infrastructure it hits + an infra-precheck, and explicitly forbids mocks (in-memory fakes, in-process stubs, monkeypatched downstreams). Unit tests may mock; integration tests may not.
- **R2 Infra gap → Infrastructure Epic:** if a task needs unwired infrastructure, do not write a mock task — emit an infra-dependency task pointing at the Infrastructure Epic and mark the test task blocked.
- **R4/R5 QA task:** the final task of a story is a QA-adversarial-real-app task: drive the REAL application on real infrastructure, audit integration tests for mocks (flag as defects), and try to break the user journey.

- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Each task file must be 100% self-contained: no "see architecture doc" — inline the relevant excerpt verbatim
- Tasks must be tiny: 1-3 files to touch maximum, one function or feature increment per task
- Tasks must be independently testable and ordered by dependency
- Story file remains the source of truth; task files reference back to it
- ZERO USER INTERVENTION except for the optional checkpoint in Step 3

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-tasks`
- `task_template` = `{installed_path}/task-template.md`
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `story_file` = `` (explicit story path; auto-discovered if empty)
- `architecture_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`

    1. {{task_num}} = N (or Na/Nb if split)
    2. {{total_tasks}} = total count (including splits)
    3. {{task_title}} = kebab-cased task title (max 40 chars for slug)
    4. {{story_key}} = the story key
    5. {{date}} = current date
    6. {{task_description}} = full task text from story Tasks/Subtasks plus context sentence explaining WHY this task exists
    7. {{ac_refs}} = list of AC numbers this task satisfies (from "(AC: #)" annotations in story)
    8. {{dependency_on}} = "None — this is Task 1" OR "Task {{N-1}}: [title] must be complete — it creates [specific output this task needs]"
       - When a task depends on several tasks, name every ID explicitly ("Tasks 1, 2a and 2b"). Ranges and prose are legal and dev-tasks expands them (R11), but an explicit list is the least ambiguous and the cheapest to check.
    9. {{produces_for_next}} = "Creates [specific file/function/data] that Task {{N+1}} needs" OR "None — this is the final task"
    10. {{files_table}} = markdown table rows, one per file (max 3); Action = Create|Modify|Delete; What to do = specific 1-line instruction
        - If more than 3 files detected: SPLIT into Na/Nb and generate two task files instead
    11. {{implementation_instructions}} = expanded, unambiguous instructions derived from the story task + architecture context; include:
        - What function/method/component to create or modify
        - Exact function signatures if determinable
        - Data shapes/types if relevant
        - Error handling approach
        - No ambiguity — the sub-agent must not make design decisions
    12. {{subtasks_checklist}} = all subtask bullets from story converted to "- [ ] subtask text"
    13. {{architecture_excerpt}} = verbatim copy of the architecture section(s) relevant to this task's files/patterns; include section header so context is clear
    14. {{code_patterns}} = code snippets from {{prior_patterns}} or {{existing_file_context}} that this task must follow; include the actual snippet, not a description
    15. {{existing_file_excerpts}} = current content of files this task modifies (imports block, class/function signatures, key lines); label each with file path
    16. {{test_requirements}} = specific tests to write: unit test targets (function names), integration test scenarios if applicable, edge cases from story ACs; be specific, not generic
    17. {{verification_commands}} = actual runnable shell commands, e.g.:
        - npm test -- --testPathPattern=auth
        - npx jest src/services/auth.test.ts
        - npm run lint src/services/auth.ts
        Write them for the run contract (dev-tasks R10): each line is run on its own and must exit 0; a line starting with `!` passes only when its negated command fails. No line may depend on a previous line's `cd` or `export`.
        Security-critical checks (e.g. "no secret leaked into this file or log") must fail closed in both modes: print file names only (`grep -l`), pass only on grep exit 1, treat exit 2 (unreadable or missing) as a failure, and fail first when a credential the check needs reads empty. `! grep -q "$TOKEN" out.log` is NOT fail-closed — it passes when the file is missing or unreadable. Avoid `test -n "$TOKEN" && …` too: a failing test inside an `&&` list does not trip `set -e`, so the empty-token guard silently passes in block mode. Example:
        - rc=3; if test -n "$TOKEN"; then rc=0; grep -l -F -- "$TOKEN" out.log || rc=$?; fi; test "$rc" -eq 1
    18. {{do_not_list}} = task-specific prohibitions derived from architecture constraints + story Dev Notes; e.g., "Do NOT call the external API directly — use the service layer abstraction"
    19. {{stall_profile}} = classify the task's expected activity pattern:
        - `file-heavy` — (default) task primarily creates/modifies source files and tests
        - `api-heavy` — task involves MCP tool calls, API integrations, external service round-trips, or infrastructure validation where long periods pass without file writes
        - `mixed` — task does both file I/O and API/MCP calls
        Determine by inspecting: does the task call external APIs, MCP servers, or run long integration test suites? If yes → `api-heavy` or `mixed`. If purely writing code and unit tests → `file-heavy`.

    **Write task file:**
    - Filename: task-{{N}}-{{slug}}.md where slug = kebab-case of task_title
    - Path: {{tasks_dir}}/task-{{N}}-{{slug}}.md
    - Substitute ALL template variables — the output file contains NO {{variables}}, only resolved content

**Prove this gate can fail before trusting it** (R20 applies to gates too): add the line
`see the architecture doc for details` to one task file, re-run, and confirm it reports FAIL.
A gate that has only ever passed has not been tested. Remove the planted line afterwards.

Then, for each generated task file in {{tasks_dir}}, verify the remaining checks. **These are
JUDGMENT, not verification** — no command settles them, and the agent assessing them wrote
them. Say so in the output rather than reporting all eleven as "checked":

    **Self-Containment Checks (FAIL = regenerate the task):**
    1. *(mechanical, checked above)* NO external references — file must NOT contain phrases like:
       - "see architecture doc", "refer to story", "check the PRD"
       - "as described in", "per the architecture", "see above"
       - Any {project-root}/_skad/ path references to planning docs
    2. *(judgment)* Architecture excerpt is VERBATIM — not a summary, not a paraphrase, but the actual text the dev needs
    3. *(judgment)* Existing file excerpts are present — for files being modified, current imports/signatures/structure must be inlined
    4. *(mechanical for placeholders, judgment for correctness)* Verification commands are RUNNABLE — actual shell commands with real file paths, not placeholders like "run the tests" — and each line is correct when run on its own under the run contract (dev-tasks R10); any leak or secret scan fails closed (grep exit 2 and an empty credential are failures)
    5. *(judgment)* DO NOT list is specific — derived from architecture constraints, not generic boilerplate
    6. *(judgment)* Files to touch are EXACT — real file paths, not patterns or descriptions
    7. *(judgment)* Implementation instructions are UNAMBIGUOUS — function signatures, data shapes, error handling approach are specified

    **Structural Checks:**
    8. *(mechanical, checked above)* Task touches at most 3 files (Exact Files to Touch table has ≤ 3 rows)
    9. *(mechanical for presence, judgment for content)* Dependency Order section specifies what this task Requires and what it Produces, AND repeats the story's own hard dependencies — from `Depends on:` or its older spelling `Blocked on:`, whichever the story carries — a task inherits them, because a task cannot be correct on a foundation its story was never allowed to build on. Within-story ordering uses `Requires:` (task IDs); cross-story and cross-epic ordering uses `Depends on:` (item keys). Keep the two distinct: they are read by different checks; a multi-task Requires names every ID explicitly or uses a range dev-tasks can expand (R11)
    10. *(judgment)* Completion Checklist has specific, verifiable items
    11. *(mechanical, checked above)* Stall Profile is set to file-heavy, api-heavy, or mixed

    **Story file updated** with links to task files under Dev Notes → Task Files.

    Each task file is 100% self-contained — sub-agents can implement any task without loading external documents.

    **Next Steps:**
    1. Review task files in {{tasks_dir}}/ (each is self-contained, no external docs needed)
    2. Run `dev-tasks` — it will orchestrate task-by-task implementation with automated implement → review → test pipeline
    3. Or run `dev-story` for single-agent story implementation
