# QA Generate E2E Tests Workflow

**Goal:** Generate automated API and E2E tests for implemented code.

**Your Role:** You are a QA automation engineer. You generate tests ONLY — no code review or story validation (use Code Review `CR` for that).

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/workflows/qa-generate-e2e-tests`
- `checklist` = `{installed_path}/checklist.md`
- `test_dir` = `{project-root}/tests`
- `source_dir` = `{project-root}`
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/tests/test-summary.md`

### Context

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

---

## EXECUTION

### Step 0: Detect Test Framework

Check project for existing test framework:

- Look for `package.json` dependencies (playwright, jest, vitest, cypress, etc.)
- Check for existing test files to understand patterns
- Use whatever test framework the project already has
- If no framework exists:
  - Analyze source code to determine project type (React, Vue, Node API, etc.)
  - Search online for current recommended test framework for that stack
  - Suggest the meta framework and use it (or ask user to confirm)

### Step 1: Identify Features

Ask user what to test:

- Specific feature/component name
- Directory to scan (e.g., `src/components/`)
- Or auto-discover features in the codebase

### Step 2: Generate API Tests (if applicable)

For API endpoints/services, generate tests that:

- Test status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
- Validate response structure
- Cover happy path + 1-2 error cases
- Use project's existing test framework patterns

### Step 3: Generate E2E Tests (if UI exists)

For UI features, generate tests that:

- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Use semantic locators (roles, labels, text)
- Focus on user interactions (clicks, form fills, navigation)
- Assert visible outcomes
- Keep tests linear and simple
- Follow project's existing test patterns

### Step 4: Run Tests

Execute tests to verify they pass (use project's test command).

If failures occur, fix them immediately.

### Step 5: Create Summary

Output markdown summary:

```markdown
# Test Automation Summary

## Generated Tests

### API Tests
- [x] tests/api/endpoint.spec.ts - Endpoint validation

### E2E Tests
- [x] tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts - User workflow

## Coverage
- API endpoints: 5/10 covered
- UI features: 3/8 covered

## Next Steps
- Run tests in CI
- Add more edge cases as needed
```

## Keep It Simple

**Do:**

- Use standard test framework APIs
- Focus on happy path + critical errors
- Write readable, maintainable tests
- Run tests to verify they pass

**Avoid:**

- Complex fixture composition
- Over-engineering
- Unnecessary abstractions

**For Advanced Features:**

If the project needs:

- Risk-based test strategy
- Test design planning
- Quality gates and NFR assessment
- Comprehensive coverage analysis
- Advanced testing patterns and utilities

> **Install Test Architect (TEA) module**: <https://Bionic-AI-Solutions.github.io/skad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/>

## Output

Save summary to: `{default_output_file}`

## 🕵️ MANDATORY GATE — 13th Man Review (BLOCKING)

**Run this BEFORE anything below.** This stage does not close on its own say-so.

Read fully and follow: `{project-root}/_skad/core/workflows/thirteenth-man-review/workflow.md`

with `{{stage_id}}` = `qa-artifacts`, `{{artifact_paths}}` = the artifact(s) this stage
produced, and `{{claim}}` = that the tests exercise the real system and would fail if the feature broke.

**Give it the question, never the answer** — hand over what this stage set out to
establish, not what it concluded. A gate handed the conclusion confirms it.

**Pin it to a different model — and PROVE it, do not assume it.** The pin in
`.claude/agents/thirteenth-man.md` is absolute (`model: <name>`), but the
requirement is *relative*: the reviewer must differ from **whatever model is
running this session right now**. Those come apart silently the moment this
session runs on the pinned model.

So, every time:

1. Record **your own** model in the report as `DISPATCHER`.
2. The review returns the model it ran as, in `MODEL`.
3. **Compare them.** Same, or either one unknown → the report is stamped
   `MODEL: same-model (degraded)` and **you tell the user the gate ran
   degraded**. Do not let a subagent assert independence it cannot verify — it
   cannot see your model from inside.

A degraded review recorded as a normal one is worse than no review: it retires
the concern without earning it.

| Result | What happens |
|---|---|
| `refuted` | Stage does not close. Fix, then re-run this gate. |
| Any BLOCKER | Stage does not close. Resolve each, then re-run. |
| `cannot-determine` | Do not close on that point. Get the evidence, or record an explicit, owned, accepted risk. |
| `confirmed` / `partly-confirmed`, no blockers | Proceed — **after dispositioning the dissent.** |

**Blockers are not the whole output.** Every DISSENT and OBSERVATION gets a
recorded disposition — fixed, scheduled (name the task), rejected (record why),
or accepted risk (name an owner and a trigger). **An undispositioned finding is
an open finding**; acting only on blockers is how this gate gets quietly
neutered.

**HALT. This stage does not close** while the verdict is `refuted` or any BLOCKER is open. Do not announce completion, do not hand off to the next workflow, do not write any status. Address the findings and re-run this gate.

Write the report to `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/thirteenth-man/` yourself
from the block the review returns — the subagent may not have write access — and
**commit it**: it is product knowledge, not terminal output.

---

**Done!** Tests generated and verified. Validate against `{checklist}`.
