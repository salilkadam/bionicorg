# Applies the org's agent concurrency policy to the bionic-org (Reliora Inc)
# Paperclip database, so a from-scratch org recreation ends in the same safe
# state.
#
# WHY: Paperclip bounds concurrent runs only PER AGENT
# (runtimeConfig.heartbeat.maxConcurrentRuns, default 20; enforced in
# server/src/services/heartbeat.ts startNextQueuedRunForAgent via
# countRunningRunsForAgent). There is NO cross-agent/global governor. Each
# concurrent run spawns a ~1Gi adapter/CLI child inside the single control-plane
# pod (OOM ceiling 6Gi). With 5 org agents and the default 20, the worst-case
# fan-out (5 x 20) blows far past the limit.
#
# Setting maxConcurrentRuns=1 bounds the whole org to at most (agents x 1)
# concurrent children — for 5 agents ~5Gi, inside the 6Gi ceiling. Extra wakes
# are NOT dropped: they land in the durable wake-queue / run-dispatch modules and
# drain as slots free, so a burst degrades to *queueing* (slower), never an OOM.
# Raise this only together with the memory limit, keeping:
#     agents x maxConcurrentRuns x ~1Gi  <  memory limit
#
# Idempotent. Edit COMPANY_ID / PG context for your environment.
