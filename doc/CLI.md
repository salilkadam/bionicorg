# CLI Reference

Bionic CLI now supports both:

- installation and lifecycle management (`install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `upgrade`, `service`)
- instance setup/diagnostics (`onboard`, `doctor`, `configure`, `env`, `allowed-hostname`, `env-lab`)
- control-plane client operations (issues, approvals, agents, activity, dashboard)

## Security: safe invocation for content-bearing arguments

Use `npx bionicai` for any command whose argument can hold untrusted or
semi-trusted content. Untrusted content includes issue text, comment bodies,
Markdown, pasted snippets, and model output. `npx` runs the CLI binary directly.
It passes the argument as an inert `argv` value. It does not run a shell over the
value. `npx bionicai` works on any machine with Node: it runs a local install
of the `bionicai` package, and it fetches the published package when no local
install is present.

Do not use `pnpm bionicai` for a content-bearing argument. `pnpm bionicai`
is a `package.json` script. `pnpm` builds a `/bin/sh` command string and appends
the argument to it, so the shell reads the argument first. The shell interprets
these spans before the CLI starts:

- command substitution: a backtick pair or `$( )`
- variable expansion: `$NAME` or `${NAME}` (this can leak a secret value into the persisted argument)

A crafted value can run an arbitrary command as the invoking user. A crafted
value can also expand an environment variable into the stored argument. No
CLI-side check stops this, because the shell runs before `cli/src` starts. This
is true even when the argument comes from a quoted shell variable, because `pnpm`
re-evaluates the value in its own shell.

Safe forms:

- `npx bionicai <command> <args>` — the documented default. It passes an inert
  `argv` value and runs on any machine.
- `node cli/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs cli/src/index.ts <command> <args>` —
  the safe form to run the local source from a monorepo checkout. It is the exact
  command that the `pnpm bionicai` script wraps, but it runs directly, so no
  shell reads the argument. Use it when you must test your local `cli/src`
  changes with a content-bearing argument.

Unsafe or broken forms:

- `pnpm bionicai <command> <args>` — unsafe. `pnpm` runs the argument through a
  shell first.
- `pnpm run <script> -- <args>`, or any `package.json` script that wraps the CLI —
  unsafe for the same reason.
- `pnpm exec bionicai <command> <args>` — broken. The root workspace does not
  depend on the `bionicai` package, so `pnpm` does not link its binary into
  `node_modules/.bin`. The command fails with `Command "bionicai" not found`,
  even after a build. Do not use it.

Static placeholders only: a document must show a static placeholder such as
`<host>` in a command example, never a live `$( )` or `$NAME` span. The reader's
own shell expands such a span on paste, before any CLI or `npx` receives argv, so
a direct-exec form does not stop it.

`pnpm bionicai` stays acceptable only for a fully literal local lifecycle or
setup command. A fully literal command carries no substitutable value. It has no
placeholder, no example value the reader replaces, no interpolation, no path, no
ref, no id, and no name. It holds the subcommand and, at most, flags that take no
value.

The allowlist of literal commands lives in one place:
`server/src/__tests__/cli-invocation-safety.test.ts`. A guard test enforces it
fail-closed. Any `pnpm bionicai` line whose command string is not an exact
allowlist entry is an offender. The allowlist holds commands such as `run`,
`onboard`, `onboard --yes`, `doctor`, `configure --section <name>`, `connect`,
`env-lab up`, `env-lab down`, `context show`, `context list`,
`worktree ensure-seeded`, and `worktree env`.

Every invocation that carries a positional value or an option value uses
`npx bionicai` instead. This covers a hostname (`allowed-hostname`), an import
URL or folder (`company import`), an identifier or secret (`--company-id`,
`--agent-id`, `--claim-secret`), a payload (`--payload-json`), free text
(`--body`, `--title`, `--comment`), a data directory (`--data-dir`), an instance
(`--instance`), a bind preset (`--bind`), a context-profile name, and every
worktree path, ref, id, or name option. A runtime value counts as non-fixed even
when it looks safe. The private-hostname guard builds `allowed-hostname <value>`
from the request Host header, so it uses `npx bionicai`.

For a command that must run the local checked-out source with a value, use the
direct-exec form: `node cli/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs cli/src/index.ts
<command> <args>`.

The `pnpm --filter @bionicai/*` build and test commands are not CLI
invocation. They do not change.

### Offline and air-gapped use

`npx bionicai` runs offline when the `bionicai` package is already in a
local install or in the npm cache. It reaches the network only when the package
is in neither place.

To force cache-only resolution and block any network attempt, run
`npx --offline bionicai <command> <args>`. Use `npx --prefer-offline
bionicai` when you accept a fetch only for a missing package.

To prepare an air-gapped host, install the package one time while the host is
online. Run `npm install -g bionicai`, or run the documented `install.sh`
path. After that step, both `npx bionicai` and the installed `bionicai`
binary run offline. Both pass an inert `argv` value.

To move the package without a registry, run `npm pack bionicai` on an online
host. Copy the tarball to the air-gapped host. Run `npm install -g
./bionicai-<version>.tgz`.

Do not use `pnpm bionicai` as an offline fallback for a content-bearing
argument. It runs the argument through a shell first, offline or online. It also
resolves only inside a monorepo checkout.

A monorepo contributor who works offline uses the direct-exec form that this
section documents above: `node cli/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs
cli/src/index.ts <command> <args>`. It passes an inert `argv` value and runs the
local source.

## Base Usage

Use repo script in development:

```sh
pnpm bionicai --help
```

Recommended installation and interactive onboarding:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://bionic.ing/install.sh
curl -fsSLO https://bionic.ing/install.sh.sha256
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  sha256sum -c install.sh.sha256
else
  shasum -a 256 -c install.sh.sha256
fi
bash install.sh
```

The checksum detects transfer or publishing mistakes but is served from the
same origin as the installer. Use a release-tag or commit-pinned GitHub copy
when you need an independently hosted source. Piped installs require supported
Node.js, npm, and npx to already be installed; download the script first before
allowing it to bootstrap Node.js with privileged package-manager commands.

First-time local bootstrap from a source checkout:

```sh
pnpm bionicai run
```

Choose local instance:

```sh
npx bionicai run --instance dev
```

## Isolated Manual Test Drives

`bionicai test-drive` creates or reuses an isolated local data directory,
ensures one usable CEO agent exists in a fresh database, starts Bionic in the
foreground, and opens the browser after initialization succeeds. It never
installs a background service and never creates a goal, project, issue, task,
or heartbeat.

```sh
npx bionicai test-drive \
  [-d, --data-dir <path>] \
  [--company-name <name>] \
  [--agent-name <name>] \
  [--harness <claude|codex|opencode>] \
  [--model <model-id>] \
  [--api-key-env <variable> | --api-key <value>] \
  [--no-browser]
```

Defaults are `Test Company`, a `CEO` agent with the `ceo` role, and the Claude
harness. Without `--data-dir`, every invocation creates a unique OS temporary
directory and prints its absolute path. The directory is retained after exit
for inspection. An explicit data directory is reused and is never reset. The
reused directory must use Bionic's embedded database; `DATABASE_URL`,
`DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`, and configs with `database.mode: postgres` are
rejected so test-drive cannot mutate an external database. The server also
ignores the invocation directory's `.env` for test-drive launches, while still
loading the selected instance's own environment file. Reused directories also
retain the normal guard against colliding with a managed Bionic service. The
server uses the first available loopback port at or above `3100`, so an
unrelated local Bionic process can remain running.

Harness configuration:

| Harness | Agent adapter | Agent credential variable | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `claude_local` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional; omitted uses the adapter default |
| `codex` | `codex_local` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional; omitted uses the adapter default |
| `opencode` | `opencode_local` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required and must begin with `openrouter/` |

OpenCode model references retain their complete path, including additional
slashes:

```sh
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... npx bionicai test-drive \
  --harness opencode \
  --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
```

Credentials come from `--api-key`, the variable named by `--api-key-env`, or
the harness's canonical environment variable shown in the table. `--api-key`
and `--api-key-env` are mutually exclusive. A custom source variable is still
stored and projected under the canonical target variable:

```sh
MY_ROUTER_KEY=... npx bionicai test-drive \
  --harness opencode \
  --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4 \
  --api-key-env MY_ROUTER_KEY
```

Credentials are stored through Bionic's user-secret reference path and are
redacted from Bionic command output. Bionic does not print `--api-key`,
and it removes the value from its JavaScript argument view immediately after
Commander parses it. Bionic does not put the raw argument list in telemetry,
API metadata, or diagnostics. Command wrappers, operating-system process
listings, and shell history can still expose values passed in arguments. This
is an explicit tradeoff for the local test-drive workflow. Prefer an exported
canonical variable or `--api-key-env` when that matters. Provider connectivity,
local harness installation, credential validity, and model availability are
intentionally checked only when the agent first runs.

When invoked inside a linked Git worktree, the command ignores inherited
`BIONIC_IN_WORKTREE` state, launches in worktree mode, and verifies **Run
tasks in this worktree** is armed for the current instance before opening the
browser. In a primary checkout or non-Git directory it launches without
worktree mode and does not alter the setting. On reuse, if any company already
exists, all bootstrap flags are ignored and companies, agents, and secrets are
left untouched; worktree-setting reconciliation is the only permitted
mutation.

Use `--no-browser` for a foreground instance that prints its ready URL without
opening it.

## Install, Update, And Uninstall

Managed installs keep CLI payloads under `~/.bionic/cli`, expose a stable
`~/.local/bin/bionicai` shim, switch versions atomically, and retain two
previous payloads for rollback.

```sh
bionicai install
bionicai install --canary
bionicai install --version <version>
bionicai install --ref <branch|tag|sha> [--repo owner/repo]
bionicai update
bionicai update --latest|--canary|--version <version>
bionicai update --rollback
bionicai upgrade
bionicai uninstall
```

`upgrade` aliases `update`. `uninstall` removes managed code and the shim but
preserves instance data under `~/.bionic/instances/`. See
`doc/INSTALLING.md` for installation methods, security notes, PATH setup, and
the complete update and rollback behavior.

## Onboarding And Service Management

Interactive onboarding offers to install a background service on supported
platforms. `--yes` never installs it implicitly; automation must opt in.

```sh
bionicai onboard
bionicai onboard --yes
bionicai onboard --yes --install-service
bionicai onboard --yes --no-install-service
```

Service lifecycle commands remain under the `service` namespace:

```sh
bionicai service install [--no-start-now] [--no-start-on-login]
bionicai service uninstall
bionicai service start
bionicai service stop
bionicai service restart [--wait]
bionicai service status [--json]
bionicai service logs [-f]
```

Every service verb supports `--instance <id>` and `--json`. Linux and WSL2 use
a systemd user unit when available; macOS uses a LaunchAgent. Unsupported
environments receive foreground `bionicai run` guidance.

`bionicai doctor` includes managed-install and service-health diagnostics in
addition to configuration, storage, database, logging, and port checks.

## Deployment Modes

Mode taxonomy and design intent are documented in `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.

Current CLI behavior:

- `bionicai onboard` and `bionicai configure --section server` set deployment mode in config
- server onboarding/configure ask for reachability intent and write `server.bind`
- `bionicai run --bind <loopback|lan|tailnet>` passes a quickstart bind preset into first-run onboarding when config is missing
- runtime can override mode with `BIONIC_DEPLOYMENT_MODE`
- `bionicai run` and `bionicai doctor` still do not expose a direct low-level `--mode` flag

Canonical behavior is documented in `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.

Allow an authenticated/private hostname (for example custom Tailscale DNS):

```sh
npx bionicai allowed-hostname dotta-macbook-pro
```

Bring up the default local SSH fixture for environment testing:

```sh
pnpm bionicai env-lab up
pnpm bionicai env-lab doctor
pnpm bionicai env-lab status --json
pnpm bionicai env-lab down
```

All client commands support:

- `--data-dir <path>`
- `--api-base <url>`
- `--api-key <token>`
- `--context <path>`
- `--profile <name>`
- `--json`

Company-scoped commands also support `--company-id <id>`.

API base resolution order:

1. `--api-base <url>`
2. `BIONIC_API_URL`
3. selected context profile `apiBase`
4. local Bionic config server port
5. `http://localhost:3100`

Connection failures include the attempted URL and a `GET /api/health` check hint.

## Connect Wizard

```sh
pnpm bionicai connect
```

`connect` confirms the resolved API base, verifies `GET /api/health`, authenticates board access when needed, and saves a persona-aware profile:

- `persona=board` for board operator profiles
- `persona=agent` with `agentId` and `agentName` for agent profiles

Profiles store token env-var names, not plaintext tokens. The wizard prints shell exports for the newly created token.

Use `--data-dir` on any CLI command to isolate all default local state (config/context/db/logs/storage/secrets) away from `~/.bionic`:

```sh
npx bionicai run --data-dir ./tmp/bionic-dev
npx bionicai issue list --data-dir ./tmp/bionic-dev
```

## Context Profiles

Store local defaults in `~/.bionic/context.json`:

```sh
npx bionicai context set --api-base http://localhost:3100 --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai context set --persona agent --agent-id <agent-id> --api-key-env-var-name BIONIC_API_KEY
pnpm bionicai context show
pnpm bionicai context list
npx bionicai context use default
```

To avoid storing secrets in context, set `apiKeyEnvVarName` and keep the key in env:

```sh
npx bionicai context set --api-key-env-var-name BIONIC_API_KEY
export BIONIC_API_KEY=...
```

## Organization Commands

```sh
npx bionicai company list
npx bionicai company get <company-id>
npx bionicai company current [--company-id <company-id>]
npx bionicai company stats
npx bionicai company create --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company update <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company branding:update <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company archive <company-id>
npx bionicai company export <company-id> --out ./company --include company,agents,projects,issues,skills
npx bionicai company export:preview <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company export:api <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company import ./company --target new --new-company-name "Imported Company"
npx bionicai company import:preview <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company import:apply <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai company delete <company-id-or-prefix> --yes --confirm <same-id-or-prefix>
```

Examples:

```sh
npx bionicai company delete PAP --yes --confirm PAP
npx bionicai company delete 5cbe79ee-acb3-4597-896e-7662742593cd --yes --confirm 5cbe79ee-acb3-4597-896e-7662742593cd
```

Notes:

- With agent authentication, `company list` and `company current` are
  agent-safe company selectors. `company list` first tries the board-wide list;
  if that is forbidden, it uses `--company-id`, `BIONIC_COMPANY_ID`, context,
  or `/api/agents/me` and then reads only that scoped company.
- `company create` requires board/instance-admin authentication because it is
  an instance-wide setup command.
- Deletion is server-gated by `BIONIC_ENABLE_COMPANY_DELETION`.
- With agent authentication, company deletion is company-scoped. Use the current company ID/prefix (for example via `--company-id` or `BIONIC_COMPANY_ID`), not another company.

## Issue Commands

```sh
npx bionicai issue list --company-id <company-id> [--status todo,in_progress] [--assignee-agent-id <agent-id>] [--match text]

Agent configuration and runtime endpoints:

```sh
npx bionicai agent permissions:update <agent-id> --payload-json '{"canCreateAgents":true,"canCreateSkills":true,"canAssignTasks":true}'
npx bionicai agent configuration <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent config-revisions <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent config-revision:get <agent-id> <revision-id>
npx bionicai agent config-revision:rollback <agent-id> <revision-id>
npx bionicai agent runtime-state <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent runtime-state:reset-session <agent-id> [--task-key <key>]
npx bionicai agent task-sessions <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent skills <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent skills:sync <agent-id> --desired-skills bionic,github --mode add
npx bionicai agent instructions-path:update <agent-id> --payload-json '{"path":"/path/to/AGENTS.md"}'
npx bionicai agent instructions-bundle <agent-id>
npx bionicai agent instructions-bundle:update <agent-id> --payload-json '{"mode":"managed"}'
npx bionicai agent instructions-file:get <agent-id> --path AGENTS.md
npx bionicai agent instructions-file:put <agent-id> --path AGENTS.md --content-file ./AGENTS.md
npx bionicai agent instructions-file:delete <agent-id> --path AGENTS.md
```

Agent config, instructions, skills, project env, environment, secret, and workspace edits affect the next run. Active runs finish with the config they started with. When a saved session, reused workspace, or sandbox lease no longer matches the effective next-run config, Bionic may start fresh execution and records non-sensitive freshness categories in run result JSON and workspace operation logs.

`agent local-cli` is the quickest way to run local Claude/Codex manually as a Bionic agent:

- creates a new long-lived agent API key
- installs missing Bionic skills into `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`
- prints `export ...` lines for `BIONIC_API_URL`, `BIONIC_COMPANY_ID`, `BIONIC_AGENT_ID`, and `BIONIC_API_KEY`

Example for shortname-based local setup:

```sh
npx bionicai agent local-cli codexcoder --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai agent local-cli claudecoder --company-id <company-id>
```

## Token Commands

Agent API keys are scoped to one company and one agent. Plaintext tokens are printed once at creation.

```sh
npx bionicai token agent create --company-id <company-id> --agent <agent-id-or-name> --name external-worker
npx bionicai token agent list --company-id <company-id> --agent <agent-id-or-name>
npx bionicai token agent revoke --company-id <company-id> --agent <agent-id-or-name> <key-id>
```

Named board API keys use the board authorization model, support revocation and expiration metadata, and are audited server-side.

```sh
npx bionicai token board create --company-id <company-id> --name external-admin
npx bionicai token board create --name short-lived --ttl-days 7
npx bionicai token board list
npx bionicai token board revoke <key-id>
```

## Run Commands

`bionicai run` without a subcommand still bootstraps and starts a local Bionic instance. The subcommands below inspect and control API heartbeat runs.

```sh
npx bionicai run list --company-id <company-id> [--agent-id <agent-id>] [--limit 50]
npx bionicai run live --company-id <company-id> [--limit 50] [--min-count 0]
npx bionicai run get <run-id>

npx bionicai run workspace-log <operation-id> [--offset 0] [--limit-bytes 16384] [--text]
npx bionicai run watchdog-decision <run-id> --decision continue [--reason "..."]
```

## Routine Commands

`bionicai routines disable-all` remains the local maintenance command. The singular `routine` group maps to the REST API.

```sh
npx bionicai routine list --company-id <company-id> [--project-id <project-id>]
npx bionicai routine create --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai routine get <routine-id>
npx bionicai routine update <routine-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai routine revisions <routine-id>
npx bionicai routine revision:restore <routine-id> <revision-id>
npx bionicai routine runs <routine-id> [--limit 50]
npx bionicai routine run <routine-id> [--payload-json '{...}']
npx bionicai routine trigger:create <routine-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai routine trigger:update <trigger-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai routine trigger:delete <trigger-id>
npx bionicai routine trigger:rotate-secret <trigger-id>
npx bionicai routine trigger:fire <public-id> [--payload-json '{...}']
```

## Prompt Handoff

Prompt handoff creates Bionic work. It does not create a chat session.

```sh
npx bionicai agent-prompt <agent-name-or-id> <agent-api-key> "Prompt here"
npx bionicai agent prompt --agent <agent-name-or-id> --api-key-env BIONIC_API_KEY "Prompt here"
npx bionicai agent prompt --profile my-agent "Prompt here"
npx bionicai board prompt --company-id <company-id> --agent <agent-name-or-id> "Prompt here"
```

By default the command creates a `todo` issue assigned to the target agent and wakes the agent. Use `--issue <issue-id>` to add a comment to existing work, and `--no-wake` to skip the wakeup.

## Skills Commands

`bionicai skills` covers three distinct operations:

1. **Company install** — adds or updates a row in `company_skills` for the
   whole company. This is what `skills install`, `skills import`, `skills create`,
   and `skills scan-projects` do.
2. **Agent attach** — merges an agent's *desired* company skill set with an
   explicit `add`, `remove`, or `replace` mode (`skills agent sync`/`clear`).
   This is a desired-state operation on the agent's adapter config; it does not
   change the company library.
3. **Adapter runtime sync** — the adapter reconciles the desired skill set
   with files on disk and reports an `AgentSkillSnapshot` (`skills agent list`).
   `skills agent sync` triggers this automatically after updating desired state.

Required Bionic runtime skills (heartbeat, etc.) remain server-enforced and
are added on top of whatever the desired set names.

Company skill mutations (`skills install`, `skills import`, `skills create`, and
`skills scan-projects`) are open to same-company actors by default. Missing
`skills:create` grants and `canCreateSkills` settings do not deny these commands;
only an explicit company skill policy restriction does. Core safety and company
boundary checks still apply, and `agents:create` remains required when a command
also creates agents.

### Catalog (app-shipped skills)

The Bionic app ships a curated catalog under `@bionicai/skills-catalog`.
Browse and inspect commands never mutate company state; `install` adds a catalog
skill to the company library.

```sh
npx bionicai skills browse [--kind bundled|optional] [--category <slug>] [--query <text>]
npx bionicai skills search "<text>" [--kind bundled|optional] [--category <slug>]
npx bionicai skills inspect <catalog-id-or-key-or-slug>
npx bionicai skills install <catalog-id-or-key-or-slug> [--as <slug>] [--force] --company-id <company-id>
```

Catalog semantics:

- **Bundled** skills live in `packages/skills-catalog/catalog/bundled/<category>/<slug>`
  and are recommended defaults for most companies. They use canonical key
  `bionicai/bundled/<category>/<slug>`.
- **Optional** skills live in `packages/skills-catalog/catalog/optional/<category>/<slug>`
  and are role-specific or domain-specific (browser, AWS ops, etc.). Same key
  shape with `optional` in place of `bundled`.
- `skills install` materializes the catalog files into a company-managed skill
  directory and records provenance (`catalogId`, `catalogKey`, `packageVersion`,
  `originHash`, …) so future updates and audit decisions stay consistent.
- `--as <slug>` overrides the company skill slug. `--force` may replace a
  same-key catalog-managed skill but never bypasses hard validation or hard-stop
  audit findings.

Examples:

```sh
npx bionicai skills browse --kind bundled --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills search "pull request" --kind bundled
npx bionicai skills inspect github-pr-workflow
npx bionicai skills install github-pr-workflow --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills install bionicai:optional:browser:agent-browser --company-id <company-id>
```

External GitHub, skills.sh, local-path, and URL sources still go through
`skills import`; catalog commands are for the app-shipped catalog only.

### Organization library

```sh
npx bionicai skills list --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills show <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills file <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> [--path SKILL.md] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills import <source> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills create --name "Review PRs" [--slug review-prs] [--description "..."] [--body-file SKILL.md] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills scan-projects [--project-id <id>...] [--workspace-id <id>...] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills check [skill-id-or-key-or-slug] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills update <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> [--force] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills update --all [--force] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills audit [skill-id-or-key-or-slug] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills reset <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> [--yes] [--force] --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills remove <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> --yes --company-id <company-id>
```

`skills import <source>` accepts a skills.sh URL, the equivalent
`<owner>/<repo>/<skill>` shorthand, a GitHub URL, a local path, or an
`npx skills add …` command. See `references/company-skills.md` in the agent
skill bundle for the source-type table.

`skills check`, `skills update`, `skills audit`, and `skills reset` are the
maintenance loop for catalog-installed skills:

- `check` reports whether each skill's installed bytes match its pinned origin
  (`hasUpdate`, `installedHash`, `originHash`, `updateHoldReason`,
  `auditVerdict`).
- `update` installs the pinned update through the existing install-update API.
  `--all` checks every company skill and updates only those with
  `hasUpdate=true`. `--force` discards local-modification or soft-audit holds;
  hard-stop audit findings still block the update.
- `audit` re-scans installed bytes and reports findings without executing
  anything.
- `reset` reinstalls a catalog-managed skill from its pinned origin, discarding
  local edits. Prompts in a TTY; requires `--yes` for non-interactive use.

### Agent attach

```sh
npx bionicai skills agent list <agent-id-or-shortname> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills agent sync <agent-id-or-shortname> --skill <skill-id-or-key-or-slug> [--skill <skill-id-or-key-or-slug>...] --mode <add|remove|replace> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai skills agent clear <agent-id-or-shortname> --yes --company-id <company-id>
```

`skills agent sync` requires a merge mode and returns the resulting adapter
`AgentSkillSnapshot`. `add` preserves all unnamed assignments, `remove` deletes
only named assignments, and `replace` destructively overwrites the complete
non-required desired skill set.
`skills agent clear` sends an empty desired list. Required Bionic skills are
still enforced by the server in both cases.

### Notes

- Skill references accept company skill `id`, canonical `key`, or unique
  `slug`; catalog references accept catalog `id`, `key`, or unique `slug`.
- `skills file` prints raw file content in human mode so it can be piped.
- `skills create --body-file -` reads the skill markdown body from stdin.
- `skills remove`, `skills reset`, and `skills agent clear` prompt in a TTY and
  require `--yes` in non-interactive use.
- `--json` prints the raw API result for each command.

## Teams Commands

`bionicai teams` works with the app-shipped team catalog in
`@bionicai/teams-catalog`. Browse, search, inspect, and file reads do not
change company state. `preview` runs the company import planner, and `install`
imports the catalog team into an existing company.

```sh
npx bionicai teams browse [--kind bundled|optional] [--category <slug>] [--query <text>]
npx bionicai teams search "<text>" [--kind bundled|optional] [--category <slug>]
npx bionicai teams inspect <catalog-id-or-key-or-slug> [--file TEAM.md]
npx bionicai teams preview <catalog-id-or-key-or-slug> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai teams install <catalog-id-or-key-or-slug> --company-id <company-id>
```

Preview/install options:

- Under agent authentication, use `bionicai company list --json`,
  `bionicai company current --json`, or `BIONIC_COMPANY_ID` to select the
  target company. `company list` falls back to the scoped current company when
  board-wide listing is forbidden. `teams install` creates agents and therefore
  requires board authentication, an `agents:create` grant, or an agent with the
  `canCreateAgents` permission (enabled by default for newly created
  standard-trust agents; low-trust agents and pre-existing agents without an
  explicit value stay disabled).
- `--request-approval-on-forbidden` turns a 403 install denial into a linked
  board approval request instead of a raw failed command; use
  `--approval-issue-id <id>` to attach it to a specific issue. During Bionic
  task runs with `BIONIC_TASK_ID` set, this fallback is automatic so
  agent-run walkthroughs leave a pending approval path instead of a raw 403.
- `--target-manager-agent-id <id>` or `--target-manager-slug <slug>` reparents
  catalog root agents under an existing manager.
- `--agent <slug>` and `--selected-file <path>` narrow the import.
- `--collision-strategy rename|skip|replace` controls name/key collisions.
- `--allow-external-sources`, `--allow-unpinned-optional-sources`, and
  `--allow-local-path-sources` explicitly opt into higher-trust source policy.
  Local-path sources are development-only and stay blocked unless that flag is
  passed.

## Secrets Commands

```sh
npx bionicai secrets list --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai secrets declarations --company-id <company-id> [--include agents,projects] [--kind secret]
npx bionicai secrets create --company-id <company-id> --name anthropic-api-key --value-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx bionicai secrets link --company-id <company-id> --name prod-stripe-key --provider aws_secrets_manager --external-ref <provider-ref>
npx bionicai secrets doctor --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai secrets provider-configs --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:create --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:discovery-preview --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:get <config-id>
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:update <config-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:default <config-id>
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:health <config-id>
npx bionicai secrets provider-config:delete <config-id>
npx bionicai secrets remote-import:preview --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai secrets remote-import --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai secrets migrate-inline-env --company-id <company-id> [--apply]
```

Secret listing and declarations never print secret values. `create` accepts
`--value-env` so shell history does not capture the value. `link` records
provider-owned references without copying the secret value into Bionic.
For AWS-backed secrets, `secrets doctor` reports missing non-secret provider
env and the expected AWS SDK runtime credential source; do not store AWS
bootstrap credentials in Bionic secrets.

Per-company provider vaults (multiple vault instances per provider, default
vault selection, coming-soon GCP/Vault) can be configured from the board UI under
`Organization Settings → Secrets → Provider vaults` or through the provider-config CLI
commands above. See the
[secrets deploy guide](../docs/deploy/secrets.md#provider-vaults) and
[API reference](../docs/api/secrets.md#provider-vaults) for the contract.

## Approval Commands

```sh
npx bionicai approval list --company-id <company-id> [--status pending]
npx bionicai approval get <approval-id>
npx bionicai approval create --company-id <company-id> --type hire_agent --payload '{"name":"..."}' [--issue-ids <id1,id2>]
npx bionicai approval approve <approval-id> [--decision-note "..."]
npx bionicai approval reject <approval-id> [--decision-note "..."]
npx bionicai approval request-revision <approval-id> [--decision-note "..."]
npx bionicai approval resubmit <approval-id> [--payload '{"...":"..."}']
npx bionicai approval comment <approval-id> --body "..."
```

## Activity Commands

```sh
npx bionicai activity list --company-id <company-id> [--agent-id <agent-id>] [--entity-type issue] [--entity-id <id>]
npx bionicai activity create --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai activity issue <issue-id>
```

## Dashboard Commands

```sh
npx bionicai dashboard get --company-id <company-id>
```

## Org And Agent Config Commands

```sh
npx bionicai whoami
npx bionicai openapi
npx bionicai org get --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai org svg --company-id <company-id> [--out org.svg]
npx bionicai org png --company-id <company-id> [--out org.png]
npx bionicai agent-config list --company-id <company-id>
```

## Access, Profile, And Instance Commands

```sh
npx bionicai profile session
npx bionicai profile get
npx bionicai profile update --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai profile company-user <user-slug> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai invite list --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai invite create --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai invite revoke <invite-id>
npx bionicai invite show <token>
npx bionicai invite accept <token> [--payload-json '{...}']
npx bionicai invite onboarding:text <token>
npx bionicai join list --company-id <company-id> [--status pending_approval]
npx bionicai join approve <request-id> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai join reject <request-id> --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai join claim-key <request-id> --claim-secret <secret>
npx bionicai member list --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai member update <member-id> --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai member role-and-grants <member-id> --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai member permissions <member-id> --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai member archive <member-id> --company-id <company-id> [--payload-json '{...}']
npx bionicai admin user list [--query <text>]
npx bionicai admin user promote <user-id>
npx bionicai admin user demote <user-id>
npx bionicai admin user company-access <user-id>
npx bionicai admin user company-access:update <user-id> --payload-json '{...}'
```

CLI auth challenge endpoints are also exposed for tooling that needs the raw challenge lifecycle:

```sh
npx bionicai auth challenge create --payload-json '{...}'
BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET=<challenge-secret> npx bionicai auth challenge get <challenge-id> --token-env BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET
BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET=<challenge-secret> npx bionicai auth challenge approve <challenge-id> --token-env BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET
BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET=<challenge-secret> npx bionicai auth challenge cancel <challenge-id> --token-env BIONIC_CHALLENGE_SECRET
npx bionicai auth revoke-current
```

`--token <challenge-secret>` is still supported for compatibility, but `--token-env` avoids putting challenge secrets in shell history or process arguments.

Use the challenge UUID returned by `auth challenge create` for get, approve, and
cancel. With the required secret and approval authentication present, malformed
IDs return HTTP 400 before database access. A status request without a secret
returns HTTP 404. Unknown challenges or incorrect challenge secrets still return
HTTP 404. Approval requires board authentication, checked before ID validation.

## Instance Settings Commands

```sh
npx bionicai instance scheduler-heartbeats
npx bionicai instance settings:general
npx bionicai instance settings:general:update --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai instance settings:experimental
npx bionicai instance settings:experimental:update --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai instance database-backup
```

Experimental features are opt-in and are provided without compatibility guarantees. They may break, change, or be removed at any time. Use them at your own risk.

```sh
npx bionicai sidebar preferences
npx bionicai sidebar preferences:update --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai sidebar project-preferences --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai sidebar project-preferences:update --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai sidebar badges --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai inbox dismissals --company-id <company-id>
npx bionicai inbox dismiss --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{"itemKey":"run:<run-id>"}'
npx bionicai board-claim show <token>
npx bionicai board-claim claim <token> [--payload-json '{...}']
npx bionicai openclaw invite-prompt --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{...}'
npx bionicai available-skill list
npx bionicai available-skill index
npx bionicai available-skill get <skill-name>
npx bionicai llm agent-configuration
npx bionicai llm agent-configuration:adapter <adapter-type>
npx bionicai llm agent-icons
```

Hermes gateway uses the generic invite/join commands above rather than
`openclaw invite-prompt`. Create an agent invite, read
`invite onboarding:text`, submit a join request with
`adapterType: "hermes_gateway"` and `agentDefaultsPayload.apiBaseUrl` /
`agentDefaultsPayload.apiKey`, then approve and claim the key with the `join`
commands. See [HERMES_GATEWAY_ONBOARDING.md](./HERMES_GATEWAY_ONBOARDING.md).

```

Feedback traces can be fetched directly by ID when automating export workflows:

```sh
npx bionicai feedback trace <trace-id>
npx bionicai feedback bundle <trace-id>
```

## Heartbeat Command

`heartbeat run` now also supports context/api-key options and uses the shared client stack:

```sh
npx bionicai heartbeat run --agent-id <agent-id> [--api-base http://localhost:3100] [--api-key <token>]
```

## Local Storage Defaults

Local Bionic data lives under the selected instance root. `BIONIC_HOME` chooses the home directory and `BIONIC_INSTANCE_ID` chooses the instance.

```text

Default paths for the canonical install:

- config: `~/.bionic/instances/default/config.json`
- embedded db: `~/.bionic/instances/default/db`
- logs: `~/.bionic/instances/default/logs`
- storage: `~/.bionic/instances/default/data/storage`
- secrets key: `~/.bionic/instances/default/secrets/master.key`

Override base home or instance with env vars:

```sh
BIONIC_HOME=/custom/home BIONIC_INSTANCE_ID=dev pnpm bionicai run
```

## Storage Configuration

Configure storage provider and settings:

```sh
pnpm bionicai configure --section storage
```

Supported providers:

- `local_disk` (default; local single-user installs)
- `s3` (S3-compatible object storage)
